    <p class="wonder-description">The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It stands as a timeless symbol of ancient engineering and human ambition. Believed to have been built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Khufu, the pyramid originally stood at about 146.6 meters tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Constructed from an estimated 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, each weighing several tons, the precision and scale of the pyramidâ€™s design continue to amaze historians and architects today.
        <br>
        It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one still largely intact. Egyptologists conclude that it was built in the 26th century BC, during a period of roughly 27 years, using an incredible amount of manpower, planning, and ingenuity. Despite countless theories, the exact methods used to transport and place the massive stones remain one of the greatest mysteries in archaeology. Today, the Great Pyramid stands as a lasting testament to the skill, power, and vision of ancient Egypt.</p>
