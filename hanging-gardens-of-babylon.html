    <p class="wonder-description">The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. There are no extant Babylonian texts that mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon. According to one legend, the gardens were built by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC. He is said to have constructed the gardens to please his wife, Amytis of Media, who longed for the trees and mountainous landscapes of her homeland.</p>
