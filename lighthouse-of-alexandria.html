    <p class="wonder-description">The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria, was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, probably completed in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for many centuries. The lighthouse was severely damaged by three earthquakes between 956 AD and 1323 AD and became an abandoned ruin. It was the third-longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the extant Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>
