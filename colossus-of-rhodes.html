    <p class="wonder-description">The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who had unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305 BC. The statue stood over 30 m (98 ft) high, making it one of the tallest statues of the ancient world.</p>
